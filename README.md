## **Project Overview**

Customer churn is one of the most critical metrics for businesses, especially in the banking and telecom sectors. This project aims to:

- Identify patterns and trends in customer behavior.
- Predict potential churners using machine learning.
- Analyze customer data with SQL and Excel for deeper insights.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for data visualization and decision-making.

**Tools & Technologies Used:**

- **Python**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, model building (Random Forest)
- **SQL**: Writing queries and performing data analysis
- **Excel**: Data exploration and creating structured templates
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard creation

**Machine Learning Model:**

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: 84%

## **Project Pipeline**

The project follows a **structured pipeline** for end-to-end analysis:

### **1. Data Ingestion**
- Importing the dataset into Python for analysis.

### **2. Data Inspection**
- Checking dataset structure, data types, and initial summary statistics.

### **3. Data Preprocessing**
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating new features relevant to churn prediction.

### **4. Model Building & Evaluation**
- Built a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn.
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.

### **5. Model Testing**
- Tested the model on unseen data to check generalization.

### **6. SQL Analysis**
- Executed SQL queries to derive key insights from the dataset.

### **7. Excel Analysis**
- Performed exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns.
- Created **structured templates** with clean information about the dataset.

### **8. Interactive Dashboard**
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** visualizing:
  - Customer churn by credit card ownership
  - Churn by number of products
  - Churn trends over tenure
  - Funnel chart for customer journey
